# Drug Dispenser Project

This project is a smart drug dispenser system designed to automate and monitor the dispensing of medication. It consists of multiple modules and a dashboard for user interaction and monitoring.

## Project Structure

- **Cam_Module/**: Contains code and resources related to the camera module, which may be used for pill identification, monitoring, or security.
- **Dispenser_Code/**: Contains the main codebase for controlling the drug dispensing hardware and logic.
- **Dispenser_Dashboard.html**: A web-based dashboard for monitoring and controlling the dispenser, providing a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Automated dispensing of medication
- Camera integration for monitoring or pill identification
- Web dashboard for remote control and monitoring
- Modular code structure for easy maintenance and upgrades
